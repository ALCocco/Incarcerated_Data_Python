# NJ Incarcerated Census Exploration with Python

The following Python code was used to query, clean, crosstab, and visualize data from the NJ incarcerated census dataset published by the NJ Office of Information Technology. Included in this project are explorations into the age distribution, ethnic makeup, and locations of arrests for the 2023 incarcerated population. In future analyses, these techniques could be used to dive deeper into other topics including the relationship between gender and the county of arrest and how age may affect total max terms.
